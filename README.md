❤️ Wise Wellness: Cardiovascular Disease Prediction and Risk Analysis

An intelligent healthcare web application that predicts cardiovascular diseases and provides personalized risk analysis, explainable insights, and health recommendations.

Wise Wellness integrates Machine Learning, Explainable AI, Natural Language Generation (NLG), and Text-to-Speech (TTS) to make healthcare predictions more accessible and understandable.

📖 Introduction
Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) is one of the leading causes of death worldwide, accounting for millions of fatalities each year due to conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and myocardial infarction. Wise Wellness: Cardiovascular Disease Prediction and Risk Analysis is a machine learning–based web application designed to support early detection and comprehensive risk assessment of cardiovascular diseases. The system utilizes a Random Forest classifier to analyze patient health data and predict potential risks while incorporating explainable AI techniques to ensure transparency and interpretability in model predictions. In addition to generating personalized lifestyle recommendations, the application produces detailed PDF health reports that can be downloaded or shared via email, and integrates text-to-speech functionality to enhance accessibility for visually impaired patients.
